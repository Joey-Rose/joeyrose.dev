        <p style = "font-size: 13px; text-align: left;">Hi there! I'm Joey -- welcome to my personal website!
            <br> <br>
            I am a Junior at Occidental College majoring in computer science and minoring in mathematics.
            Like most people from the PNW, I am a big fan of nature and the outdoors. So, if I'm not coding, you'll most
            likely find me hiking up a mountain or something.

            <br><br>
            This past summer, I interned at a company called <a href = "https://www.pm61data.com/">Promethium</a> in Menlo Park, California. There, I 
            worked primarily on the company's backend infrastructure, developing various
            APIs to improve current feature components. One of the prototypes,
            an AWS Lambda Stepfunction to initialize the execution and retrieval of SQL query results via Presto,
            was selected to be the primary infrastucture for which asynchronous SQL queries were run in production environments,
            enabling users to perform long-running queries with 2x faster execution times. I also developed a web application that 
            visualizes status of 10+ repository pipelines and code coverage at a glance.
            <br><br>
            Prior to this software engineering internship, I interned at Occidental College over the summer, developing applications
            that automate and accelerate the various facets of web research conducted by the Department of Advancement Services. Working with a
            100,000+ constituent filled database, I used a Python Oracle Database client, Selenium, and BeautifulSoup 
            to identify 300+ undetected alumns currently working at companies with matching gift programs, find
            50+ deceased alums not yet labeled via Named Entity Recognition and cross-references with ~30,000 alumns,
            and create a script to visualizes the shortest path of relatedness between any two school affiliates. 

            <br><br>
            There are a lot of things about the future of technology that excite me, and it's hard to pick just one. While advancements will
            continue to be made, I find the collaborative spirit behind which these advancements are shared to be far more uplifting. A world where
            APIs and datasets are open sourced, and data collection policies are made transparent is a better world for everyone involved.
            As Co-President of Oxy Open Source, my school's largest CS club, I get to act on this excitement everyday, cultivating
            open-source projects that span across multiple academic departments, and organizing spaces for students to freely collaborate.
